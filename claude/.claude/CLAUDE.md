# Development Guidelines for Claude

## Tooling

The `gh` cli is installed on the system and should be used for all GitHub interactions, such as:

- Fetching issues (https://github.com/<repo>/issues/<issue-number>)
- Creating pull requests
- Commenting on issues and pull requests

## Core Philosophy

I follow a development philosophy centered on creating clean, maintainable, and robust code. This is achieved through a strong emphasis on functional programming principles, type safety, and schema-first design. All work should be done in small, incremental changes that maintain a working state throughout development.

## Quick Reference

**Key Principles:**

- No `any` types or type assertions
- Immutable data only
- Small, pure functions
- TypeScript strict mode always
- Schema-first development

**Preferred Tools:**

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **State Management**: Prefer immutable patterns

## TypeScript Guidelines

### Strict Mode Requirements

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "strictFunctionTypes": true,
    "strictBindCallApply": true,
    "strictPropertyInitialization": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "alwaysStrict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true
  }
}
```

- **No `any`** - ever. Use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- **No type assertions** (`as SomeType`) unless absolutely necessary with clear justification
- **No `@ts-ignore`** or `@ts-expect-error` without explicit explanation

### Type Definitions

- **Prefer `type` over `interface`** in all cases
- Use explicit typing where it aids clarity, but leverage inference where appropriate
- Utilize utility types effectively (`Pick`, `Omit`, `Partial`, `Required`, etc.)
- Create domain-specific types (e.g., `UserId`, `PaymentId`) for type safety
- Use Zod or any other [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/) compliant schema library to create types, by creating schemas first

```typescript
// Good
type UserId = string & { readonly brand: unique symbol };
type PaymentAmount = number & { readonly brand: unique symbol };

// Avoid
type UserId = string;
type PaymentAmount = number;
```

#### Schema-First Development with Zod

Always define your schemas first, then derive types from them:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

// Define schemas first - these provide runtime validation
const AddressDetailsSchema = z.object({
  houseNumber: z.string(),
  houseName: z.string().optional(),
  addressLine1: z.string().min(1),
  addressLine2: z.string().optional(),
  city: z.string().min(1),
  postcode: z.string().regex(/^[A-Z]{1,2}\d[A-Z\d]? ?\d[A-Z]{2}$/i),
});

const PayingCardDetailsSchema = z.object({
  cvv: z.string().regex(/^\d{3,4}$/),
  token: z.string().min(1),
});

const PostPaymentsRequestV3Schema = z.object({
  cardAccountId: z.string().length(16),
  amount: z.number().positive(),
  source: z.enum(["Web", "Mobile", "API"]),
  accountStatus: z.enum(["Normal", "Restricted", "Closed"]),
  lastName: z.string().min(1),
  dateOfBirth: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/),
  payingCardDetails: PayingCardDetailsSchema,
  addressDetails: AddressDetailsSchema,
  brand: z.enum(["Visa", "Mastercard", "Amex"]),
});

// Derive types from schemas
type AddressDetails = z.infer<typeof AddressDetailsSchema>;
type PayingCardDetails = z.infer<typeof PayingCardDetailsSchema>;
type PostPaymentsRequestV3 = z.infer<typeof PostPaymentsRequestV3Schema>;

// Use schemas at runtime boundaries
export const parsePaymentRequest = (data: unknown): PostPaymentsRequestV3 => {
  return PostPaymentsRequestV3Schema.parse(data);
};

// Example of schema composition for complex domains
const BaseEntitySchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  createdAt: z.date(),
  updatedAt: z.date(),
});

const CustomerSchema = BaseEntitySchema.extend({
  email: z.string().email(),
  tier: z.enum(["standard", "premium", "enterprise"]),
  creditLimit: z.number().positive(),
});

type Customer = z.infer<typeof CustomerSchema>;
```

## Code Style

### Functional Programming

I follow a "functional light" approach:

- **No data mutation** - work with immutable data structures
- **Pure functions** wherever possible
- **Composition** as the primary mechanism for code reuse
- Avoid heavy FP abstractions (no need for complex monads or pipe/compose patterns) unless there is a clear advantage to using them
- Use array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) over imperative loops

#### Examples of Functional Patterns

```typescript
// Good - Pure function with immutable updates
const applyDiscount = (order: Order, discountPercent: number): Order => {
  return {
    ...order,
    items: order.items.map((item) => ({
      ...item,
      price: item.price * (1 - discountPercent / 100),
    })),
    totalPrice: order.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * (1 - discountPercent / 100), 0),
  };
};

// Good - Composition over complex logic
const processOrder = (order: Order): ProcessedOrder => {
  return pipe(order, validateOrder, applyPromotions, calculateTax, assignWarehouse);
};

// When heavy FP abstractions ARE appropriate:
// - Complex async flows that benefit from Task/IO types
// - Error handling chains that benefit from Result/Either types
// Example with Result type for complex error handling:
type Result<T, E = Error> = { success: true; data: T } | { success: false; error: E };

const chainPaymentOperations = (payment: Payment): Result<Receipt, PaymentError> => {
  return pipe(validatePayment(payment), chain(authorizePayment), chain(capturePayment), map(generateReceipt));
};
```

### Code Structure

- **No nested if/else statements** - use early returns, guard clauses, or composition
- **Avoid deep nesting** in general (max 2 levels)
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer flat, readable code over clever abstractions

### Naming Conventions

- **Functions**: `camelCase`, verb-based (e.g., `calculateTotal`, `validatePayment`)
- **Types**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `PaymentRequest`, `UserProfile`)
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for true constants, `camelCase` for configuration
- **Files**: `kebab-case.ts` for all TypeScript files

### No Comments in Code

Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure. Comments indicate that the code itself is not clear enough.

```typescript
// Avoid: Comments explaining what the code does
const calculateDiscount = (price: number, customer: Customer): number => {
  // Check if customer is premium
  if (customer.tier === "premium") {
    // Apply 20% discount for premium customers
    return price * 0.8;
  }
  // Regular customers get 10% discount
  return price * 0.9;
};

// Good: Self-documenting code with clear names
const PREMIUM_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER = 0.8;
const STANDARD_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER = 0.9;

const isPremiumCustomer = (customer: Customer): boolean => {
  return customer.tier === "premium";
};

const calculateDiscount = (price: number, customer: Customer): number => {
  const discountMultiplier = isPremiumCustomer(customer) ? PREMIUM_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER : STANDARD_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER;

  return price * discountMultiplier;
};

// Avoid: Complex logic with comments
const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  // First validate the payment
  if (!validatePayment(payment)) {
    throw new Error("Invalid payment");
  }

  // Check if we need to apply 3D secure
  if (payment.amount > 100 && payment.card.type === "credit") {
    // Apply 3D secure for credit cards over £100
    const securePayment = apply3DSecure(payment);
    // Process the secure payment
    return executePayment(securePayment);
  }

  // Process the payment
  return executePayment(payment);
};

// Good: Extract to well-named functions
const requires3DSecure = (payment: Payment): boolean => {
  const SECURE_PAYMENT_THRESHOLD = 100;
  return payment.amount > SECURE_PAYMENT_THRESHOLD && payment.card.type === "credit";
};

const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  if (!validatePayment(payment)) {
    throw new PaymentValidationError("Invalid payment");
  }

  const securedPayment = requires3DSecure(payment) ? apply3DSecure(payment) : payment;

  return executePayment(securedPayment);
};
```

**Exception**: JSDoc comments for public APIs are acceptable when generating documentation, but the code should still be self-explanatory without them.

### Prefer Options Objects

Use options objects for function parameters as the default pattern. Only use positional parameters when there's a clear, compelling reason (e.g., single-parameter pure functions, well-established conventions like `map(item => item.value)`).

```typescript
// Avoid: Multiple positional parameters
const createPayment = (
  amount: number,
  currency: string,
  cardId: string,
  customerId: string,
  description?: string,
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>,
  idempotencyKey?: string
): Payment => {
  // implementation
};

// Calling it is unclear
const payment = createPayment(100, "GBP", "card_123", "cust_456", undefined, { orderId: "order_789" }, "key_123");

// Good: Options object with clear property names
type CreatePaymentOptions = {
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  cardId: string;
  customerId: string;
  description?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
  idempotencyKey?: string;
};

const createPayment = (options: CreatePaymentOptions): Payment => {
  const { amount, currency, cardId, customerId, description, metadata, idempotencyKey } = options;

  // implementation
};

// Clear and readable at call site
const payment = createPayment({
  amount: 100,
  currency: "GBP",
  cardId: "card_123",
  customerId: "cust_456",
  metadata: { orderId: "order_789" },
  idempotencyKey: "key_123",
});

// Avoid: Boolean flags as parameters
const fetchCustomers = (
  includeInactive: boolean,
  includePending: boolean,
  includeDeleted: boolean,
  sortByDate: boolean
): Customer[] => {
  // implementation
};

// Confusing at call site
const customers = fetchCustomers(true, false, false, true);

// Good: Options object with clear intent
type FetchCustomersOptions = {
  includeInactive?: boolean;
  includePending?: boolean;
  includeDeleted?: boolean;
  sortBy?: "date" | "name" | "value";
};

const fetchCustomers = (options: FetchCustomersOptions = {}): Customer[] => {
  const { includeInactive = false, includePending = false, includeDeleted = false, sortBy = "name" } = options;

  // implementation
};

// Self-documenting at call site
const customers = fetchCustomers({
  includeInactive: true,
  sortBy: "date",
});

// Good: Configuration objects for complex operations
type ProcessOrderOptions = {
  order: Order;
  shipping: {
    method: "standard" | "express" | "overnight";
    address: Address;
  };
  payment: {
    method: PaymentMethod;
    saveForFuture?: boolean;
  };
  promotions?: {
    codes?: string[];
    autoApply?: boolean;
  };
};

const processOrder = (options: ProcessOrderOptions): ProcessedOrder => {
  const { order, shipping, payment, promotions = {} } = options;

  // Clear access to nested options
  const orderWithPromotions = promotions.autoApply ? applyAvailablePromotions(order) : order;

  return executeOrder({
    ...orderWithPromotions,
    shippingMethod: shipping.method,
    paymentMethod: payment.method,
  });
};

// Acceptable: Single parameter for simple transforms
const double = (n: number): number => n * 2;
const getName = (user: User): string => user.name;

// Acceptable: Well-established patterns
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map((n) => n * 2);
const users = fetchUsers();
const names = users.map((user) => user.name);
```

**Guidelines for options objects:**

- Default to options objects unless there's a specific reason not to
- Always use for functions with optional parameters
- Destructure options at the start of the function for clarity
- Provide sensible defaults using destructuring
- Keep related options grouped (e.g., all shipping options together)
- Consider breaking very large options objects into nested groups

**When positional parameters are acceptable:**

- Single-parameter pure functions
- Well-established functional patterns (map, filter, reduce callbacks)
- Mathematical operations where order is conventional

## Development Workflow

### Refactoring

Refactoring is a continuous process of improving code quality. After a feature is complete or a bug is fixed, you MUST assess whether the code can be improved. However, only refactor if there's clear value - if the code is already clean and expresses intent well, move on.

#### What is Refactoring?

Refactoring means changing the internal structure of code without changing its external behavior. The public API remains unchanged, but the code becomes cleaner, more maintainable, or more efficient. Remember: only refactor when it genuinely improves the code - not all code needs refactoring.

#### When to Refactor

- **After a feature is complete**: Before moving on, evaluate if refactoring would add value.
- **When you see duplication**: But understand what duplication really means (see DRY below).
- **When names could be clearer**: Variable names, function names, or type names that don't clearly express intent.
- **When structure could be simpler**: Complex conditional logic, deeply nested code, or long functions.
- **When patterns emerge**: After implementing several similar features, useful abstractions may become apparent.

**Remember**: Not all code needs refactoring. If the code is already clean, expressive, and well-structured, commit and move on. Refactoring should improve the code - don't change things just for the sake of change.

#### Refactoring Guidelines

##### 1. Commit Before Refactoring

Always commit your working code before starting any refactoring. This gives you a safe point to return to:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add payment validation"
# Now safe to refactor
```

##### 2. Look for Useful Abstractions Based on Semantic Meaning

Create abstractions only when code shares the same semantic meaning and purpose. Don't abstract based on structural similarity alone - **duplicate code is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction**.

```typescript
// Similar structure, DIFFERENT semantic meaning - DO NOT ABSTRACT
const validatePaymentAmount = (amount: number): boolean => {
  return amount > 0 && amount <= 10000;
};

const validateTransferAmount = (amount: number): boolean => {
  return amount > 0 && amount <= 10000;
};

// These might have the same structure today, but they represent different
// business concepts that will likely evolve independently.
// Payment limits might change based on fraud rules.
// Transfer limits might change based on account type.
// Abstracting them couples unrelated business rules.

// Similar structure, SAME semantic meaning - SAFE TO ABSTRACT
const formatUserDisplayName = (firstName: string, lastName: string): string => {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`.trim();
};

const formatCustomerDisplayName = (firstName: string, lastName: string): string => {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`.trim();
};

// These all represent the same concept: "how we format a person's name for display"
// They share semantic meaning, not just structure
const formatPersonDisplayName = (firstName: string, lastName: string): string => {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`.trim();
};
```

**Questions to ask before abstracting:**

- Do these code blocks represent the same concept or different concepts that happen to look similar?
- If the business rules for one change, should the others change too?
- Would a developer reading this abstraction understand why these things are grouped together?
- Am I abstracting based on what the code IS (structure) or what it MEANS (semantics)?

**Remember**: It's much easier to create an abstraction later when the semantic relationship becomes clear than to undo a bad abstraction that couples unrelated concepts.

##### 3. Understanding DRY - It's About Knowledge, Not Code

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is about not duplicating **knowledge** in the system, not about eliminating all code that looks similar.

```typescript
// This is NOT a DRY violation - different knowledge despite similar code
const validateUserAge = (age: number): boolean => {
  return age >= 18 && age <= 100;
};

const validateProductRating = (rating: number): boolean => {
  return rating >= 1 && rating <= 5;
};

// These functions have similar structure (checking numeric ranges), but they
// represent completely different business rules.

// This IS a DRY violation - same knowledge in multiple places
class Order {
  calculateTotal(): number {
    const itemsTotal = this.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
    const shippingCost = itemsTotal > 50 ? 0 : 5.99; // Knowledge duplicated!
    return itemsTotal + shippingCost;
  }
}

class OrderSummary {
  getShippingCost(itemsTotal: number): number {
    return itemsTotal > 50 ? 0 : 5.99; // Same knowledge!
  }
}

// Refactored - knowledge in one place
const FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD = 50;
const STANDARD_SHIPPING_COST = 5.99;

const calculateShippingCost = (itemsTotal: number): number => {
  return itemsTotal > FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD ? 0 : STANDARD_SHIPPING_COST;
};

// Now all classes use the single source of truth
class Order {
  calculateTotal(): number {
    const itemsTotal = this.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
    return itemsTotal + calculateShippingCost(itemsTotal);
  }
}
```

##### 4. Maintain External APIs During Refactoring

Refactoring must never break existing consumers of your code.

```typescript
// Original implementation
export const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  // Complex logic all in one function
  // ... 50 more lines of validation and processing
  return result;
};

// Refactored - external API unchanged, internals improved
export const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  validatePaymentAmount(payment.amount);
  validatePaymentMethod(payment.method);
  const authorizedPayment = authorizePayment(payment);
  const capturedPayment = capturePayment(authorizedPayment);
  return generateReceipt(capturedPayment);
};
```

##### 5. Verify and Commit After Refactoring

**CRITICAL**: After every refactoring:

1. Run static analysis (linting, type checking) - must pass
2. Commit the refactoring separately from feature changes

```bash
# After refactoring
npm run lint      # All linting must pass
npm run typecheck # TypeScript must be happy

# Only then commit
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: extract payment validation helpers"
```

### Commit Guidelines

- Each commit should represent a complete, working change
- Use conventional commits format:
  ```
  feat: add payment validation
  fix: correct date formatting in payment processor
  refactor: extract payment validation logic
  ```

### Pull Request Standards

- All linting and quality checks must pass
- Work in small increments that maintain a working state
- PRs should be focused on a single feature or fix
- Include description of the behavior change, not implementation details

## Working with Claude

### Expectations

When working with my code:

1. **Think deeply** before making any edits
2. **Understand the full context** of the code and requirements
3. **Ask clarifying questions** when requirements are ambiguous
4. **Think from first principles** - don't make assumptions
5. **Assess refactoring after every feature** - Look for opportunities to improve code structure, but only refactor if it adds value
6. **Keep project docs current** - update them whenever you introduce meaningful changes

### Code Changes

When suggesting or making changes:

- After implementing a feature, always assess refactoring opportunities (but only refactor if it adds value)
- After refactoring, verify all static analysis passes, then commit
- Respect the existing patterns and conventions
- Keep changes small and incremental
- Ensure all TypeScript strict mode requirements are met
- Provide rationale for significant design decisions

### Communication

- Be explicit about trade-offs in different approaches
- Explain the reasoning behind significant design decisions
- Flag any deviations from these guidelines with justification
- Suggest improvements that align with these principles
- When unsure, ask for clarification rather than assuming

## Example Patterns

### Error Handling

Use Result types or early returns:

```typescript
// Good - Result type pattern
type Result<T, E = Error> = { success: true; data: T } | { success: false; error: E };

const processPayment = (payment: Payment): Result<ProcessedPayment, PaymentError> => {
  if (!isValidPayment(payment)) {
    return { success: false, error: new PaymentError("Invalid payment") };
  }

  if (!hasSufficientFunds(payment)) {
    return { success: false, error: new PaymentError("Insufficient funds") };
  }

  return { success: true, data: executePayment(payment) };
};

// Also good - early returns with exceptions
const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  if (!isValidPayment(payment)) {
    throw new PaymentError("Invalid payment");
  }

  if (!hasSufficientFunds(payment)) {
    throw new PaymentError("Insufficient funds");
  }

  return executePayment(payment);
};
```

## Common Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-patterns

```typescript
// Avoid: Mutation
const addItem = (items: Item[], newItem: Item) => {
  items.push(newItem); // Mutates array
  return items;
};

// Prefer: Immutable update
const addItem = (items: Item[], newItem: Item): Item[] => {
  return [...items, newItem];
};

// Avoid: Nested conditionals
if (user) {
  if (user.isActive) {
    if (user.hasPermission) {
      // do something
    }
  }
}

// Prefer: Early returns
if (!user || !user.isActive || !user.hasPermission) {
  return;
}
// do something

// Avoid: Large functions
const processOrder = (order: Order) => {
  // 100+ lines of code
};

// Prefer: Composed small functions
const processOrder = (order: Order) => {
  const validatedOrder = validateOrder(order);
  const pricedOrder = calculatePricing(validatedOrder);
  const finalOrder = applyDiscounts(pricedOrder);
  return submitOrder(finalOrder);
};
```

## Summary

The key is to write clean, maintainable, functional code that evolves through small, safe increments. The implementation should be the simplest thing that works and clearly expresses its intent. When in doubt, favor simplicity and readability over cleverness.
