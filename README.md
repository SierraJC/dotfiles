# Dotfiles

A personal dotfiles repository for quickly setting up a consistent development environment. This repository is primarily designed for macOS systems and includes configurations for shell (zsh), Git, iTerm2, and more.

## Requirements

- macOS (this setup is specifically designed for Apple systems)
- Homebrew (will be installed if not present)

> **Note:** Ubuntu/Linux support will be added in a future update.

## Installation

To set up, assuming `git` is already installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sierrajc/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd $HOME/.dotfiles
bash install.sh
```
